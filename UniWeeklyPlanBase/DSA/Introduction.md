# What is a Data Structure?
# A container that stores and organizes data so you can work with it efficiently.
# Just like you use different tools for different jobs 
# (hammer vs screwdriver), you use different data structures for different tasks (stack vs queue vs list).


# Different tasks need different ways to store data:

# Stack (like a stack of plates) - Add/remove from TOP only
# Queue (like a line at a store) - Add at BACK, remove from FRONT
# List - Access data anywhere, in any order
# Priority Queue - Most important item comes out first

# Each structure is optimized for specific operations.


# Data Structure = A way to group related data together and organize it for efficient use
# Examples of "related data":

# A list of students
# A collection of movies
# A set of numbers
# Bank account records


# You've already used data structures in Python!

# Lists [1, 2, 3, 4] - Python's built-in data structure
# Tuples (1, 2, 3) - Like lists but can't be changed
